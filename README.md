# picostation_test

This version was a rewrite of the original picostation code. This does not boot games for some reason and I was not able to figure out the reason why. This plays CDDA images. I'm releasing it as a quick way to test early adopter picostation boards. This can also serve as a starting point for anyone who wants to write an ODE. This was tested ONLY on PU-18.

Instructions:
1. Flash .uf2 to pico
2. Download "Street Music" (https://archive.org/details/streetmusiccdbincue) and add the .cue and .bin files on the root of SD card



Note that you can use any audio CD image, I just found that first.
